# CCCAROUSEL

This repository contains a test of the React port of two carousel plugins originally written in JQuery:

* [Owl-carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) and

* [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

To start the app locally after git cloning it:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
